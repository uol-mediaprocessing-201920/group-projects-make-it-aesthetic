# Make it Aesthetic!

In the project "Make it Aesthetic" that is part of the module Media Processing held at Carl-von-Ossietzky University of Oldenburg we have the aim to make existing photos more aesthetic.

A lot of people take photos to record certain situations or a particularly beautiful moment in nature, such as a sunset.

Nowadays almost everyone takes photos but not everyone follows certain guidelines that for example a professional photographer would follow. In order to make it possible for everyone to align their photos according to guidelines, we want to develop an algorithm in our project which aligns and cuts the pictures according to these guidelines. To reach this goal it is necessary to define the guidelines of an aesthetic photo and to define which object is the main object of the photo
